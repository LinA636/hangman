command line game "hangman".

When the program is started you can either continue a saved game or start a new game, where the script selects randomly a word between 5 and 12 characters from the dictionary as the secret word. If a letter is correctly chosen, it is shown, as well as the number of incorrect guesses still allowed. The guessed letter is case insensitive.
You win if you guess all the right letters without running out of guesses.
Youre able to save the game at every start of a guess.
